## How should the code work?
Easy just run on trminal

- php artisan serv
- Php artisan migration
- Php artisan db:seed

   And then open localhost if you need to be a superadmin and take all permissions please login with 
- admin@website.com and password 12345678

If you need to be another admin please login with
   - admin2@website.com with password 12345678
   

then open 
- http://localhost:8000/admin
 

If you need to be a user please register and verify your email
## Thinking process

1-i understand what the admin want to be exist if he is in a website have just users and posts.

2-defined a problems and solved it as if the user were , I don't want the ordinary user to see admin part and if the user is not an super admin I want him to just control his own posts and informations

3-i chose the best way of solutions for users to solve the problems after searching

4-i tested a lot static and dynamic testing all pages and code with all data
