## How should the code work?
Easy just run on trminal

- php artisan serv
- Php artisan migration
- Php artisan db:seed

   And the open localhost is you need to be superadmin and take all permissions please login with 
- admin@website.com and password 12345678

If you need to be anther admin please login with
   - admin2@website.com with password 12345678
   

then open 
- http://localhost:8000/admin
 

If you need to be a user please register and verify your email
## Thinking process

1-i understand what the admin want to be exit if he is in a website have just users and posts 

2-defined a problems and solved it as is the user were an user I don't want him to see admin part and is the user is not an super admin I want him to just control his own posts and information

3-i choose the best way of solutions for users  to the problems after searching

4-i tested a lot static and dynamic testing all pages and code with all data
